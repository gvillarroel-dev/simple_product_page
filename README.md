## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/media/thumbnail.png)

I created a complete product page for men's running shoes that mimics the design and functionality of e-commerce websites. The page includes product images, detailed descriptions, featured features, and interactive buttons, all with a clean and modern design.

### What I learned

- **Complex Grid Layouts**: Using CSS Grid to create sophisticated product page layouts.
- **E-commerce UI Patterns**: Understanding how to position and style breadcrumbs, featured products, and call-to-action buttons for optimal user experience.

## Built with

- HTML5 Semantic Structure
- CSS3 Grid Layout System
- CSS3 Flexbox for Component Alignment
- CSS Media Queries
- Mobile-first Design Approach

## Features

- **Complete Product Information**: A well-structured title, detailed description, and notable features inform potential buyers.
- **Complex Grid Layouts**: A sophisticated CSS grid layout organizes product information in an intuitive and visually appealing way.
- **Interactive Elements**: Stylish buttons and hover effects for user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The design adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile devices, maintaining visual appeal and usability.

This [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) project reinforced the importance of grid systems and typography in creating professional e-commerce interfaces.
